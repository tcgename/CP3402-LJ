The whole practical1 practice left us very little time. First we need to think about what our business is about. In the beginning, I think choosing a good business direction is a very important step. First I need to understand the demand and competition of the target market. Determine where your product or service is positioned in the market. Second, define your target customer group and understand their needs and preferences. This helps you better position and market your product or service. In my opinion, a good entrepreneurial project is one that can survive for a long time and gradually make profits. Combined with the development of today's society, people are more and more satisfied with the material needs, and began to pursue spiritual needs. More began to pay attention to their own health, especially dental problems. Therefore, I want to set up a dental clinic, which focuses on orthodontic treatment, focusing on the more technically difficult invisible correction.

After determining the direction of entrepreneurship, I began to make a startup website. The website is mainly to introduce the direction of the clinic, as well as various types of consultation prices, which is very important for patients. In addition, we also introduced our strong team of physicians, which can make patients more confident in our clinic's technology. I also encountered some technical difficulties while making it. For example, some programming difficulties, I do not want my website to be very boring, so I added a wheel map in the page, can increase the vitality of the website page. But to do this you need Java Script technology. I'm not familiar with this, so I looked up a lot of information on the Internet. See as below. You need to get the tag corresponding to the html first, and then define the call autoplay function, and define the image switch function. It was a huge amount of learning and challenge for me. But it was a success in the end.

At the same time, although some aspects are done well, the overall is too rough. Because there is not much time left, some beautification standards are abandoned in the control of the overall project, resulting in some pages looking very simple. But the whole page is finished. In the future business, the web page will be constantly upgraded and improved, so as to give users a better browsing experience.

The next step is to publish the website. Publishing a website usually involves choosing the right hosting service or platform, rather than directly using an application that publishes a website. They provide convenient tools and interfaces that allow me to easily create and publish websites. So I compared three common publishing platforms: SiteGround, GitHub Pages, and Netlify. GitHub Pages is suitable for open source projects, especially static Git-based websites that offer free hosting and Git integration. SiteGround is a traditional hosted service for all kinds of websites, including dynamic content, with cPanel control panel and professional customer support. Netlify is suitable for websites built with modern JavaScript frameworks, offering automated deployment, global CDN, and serverless capabilities in a free package for small and medium-sized projects. The choice depends on your project needs, if it is an open source project, GitHub Pages is a good choice; If you need more flexible hosting options, SiteGround is suitable for a variety of projects; For modern JavaScript frameworks, Netlify offers powerful features and Git integration.

The entire self-learning and working time is about 14h.
